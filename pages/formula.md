I was a member of the suspension subteam on Northwestern Formula Racing from 2021-2023. I designed and manufactured the steering system and uprights.

# Steering

## Design

I started with the minimum turn radius on the track to define the steering geometry following the Ackermann model.

This animation shows steering powered by a rack and pinion.

I then created a SolidWorks assembly of the system. I used torsional stress equations and FEA to ensure parts could withstand the loads within a factor of safety.
