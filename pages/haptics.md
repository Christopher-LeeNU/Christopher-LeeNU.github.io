This project focuses on achieving high gain bilateral feedback control for a robotic glove and hand, meaning that the robot hand will mimick your hand and you will feel forces the robot feels. 
This project was commissioned by the Department of Energy so that researchers can remotely do dexterous tasks to avoid severe radiation exposure. 
The first 6 months of the project were for creating an alpha prototype as a capstone project. 
In the second iteration, we focused on optimizing for manufacturability and further mimicking human hand proportions. This project was pretty awesome. 

# Iteration 1: Haptic Haywire

The overall team was 20 people. I was in the 5 person haptic finger subteam. We created a 2 rotational joint robot that fit over the wearer's index finger. 
We decided to use a cable transmission ratio since it was low friction and had no backlash (as opposed to gears which have backlash). 
We quickly learned that although this worked very well when set up properly, setting it up properly was pretty difficult. Over several iterations, we designed the system to have 
accessible and intuitive tensioning mechanisms. Parts were CNC machined or waterjet.
