My Kale Bell Train is an injection-molded toy train, created as a team project by a group of four students, and gifted to our professor whose name inspired the design. This project was a highly rewarding experience, showcasing our skills in design, engineering, and manufacturing.

## Concept and Design

The project began with a simple concept sketch of the train. From there, we developed detailed CAD models using Siemens NX. The models included both the train and a cart, designed with precision to ensure they could be manufactured efficiently and accurately.

## Mold Design and Manufacturing
We focused on creating cores and molds that adhered to best practices for injection molding. Key considerations included:

Uniform Wall Thickness: To prevent defects and ensure consistent quality.
Draft Angles: To facilitate easy removal of the parts from the molds.
Proper Runner Placement: To ensure smooth flow of the molten material and reduce waste.  

After finalizing the designs, we used CNC machining to create the cores and molds from durable materials.

## Injection Molding Process
For the injection molding process, we chose Polypropylene due to its excellent balance of properties, including durability and ease of molding. The parts were injected, cooled, and then assembled into the final train and cart.

## Outcome and Presentation
The completed Kale Bell Train was presented to our professor, who was very pleased with the result. The project not only allowed us to apply our theoretical knowledge but also provided practical experience in CAD modeling, CNC machining, and injection molding.

This portfolio entry highlights the successful execution of a comprehensive engineering project, from concept to finished product.
