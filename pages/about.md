Hi there! I'm Chris Lee. Iâ€™m a mechanical engineer and hobbyist artist. I received my Bachelors and Masters in mechanical engineering from Northwestern University, and I hope to make devices for a healthier more sustainable world. I am interested in robotics, embedded systems, and product design. As an artist, I am interested in surrealism, comics, origami, and the integration of engineering in arts.
